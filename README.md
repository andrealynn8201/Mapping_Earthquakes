# Mapping Earthquakes

## Overview

We were asked to show our capabilities in:

* Leaflet
* Javascript
* GeoJSON
* HTML

We were able to accomplish this by creating a map that met certain criteria. First to show earthquakes for the last 7 days.  Second was to show the tectonic plate out lines.  Third was to create circle points that show greater than 4.5 magnitude earthquakes that were scaled by their magnitude using their own color scheme.   We also were tasked to create a third layer to the map, which I chose to make a dark map, along with the satellite and street maps already created.

## Results

As seen here, this was the end result of using Leaflet, Javascript, GeoJSON and HTML:
